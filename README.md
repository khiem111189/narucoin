* Forked from https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin
* The modification are changing the *Litecoin* name into *Narucoin*; setting new values to some parameters like the hash prefix, etc to make the Narucoin has its owned profile.
* Narucoin is from Naruto. Therefore we have three units including *Narc*:Naruto > *Sasus*:Sasuke > *Borus*:Boruto.
* The detail work is in this doc.
